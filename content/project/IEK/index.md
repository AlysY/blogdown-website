Indigenous Australians represent the oldest living culture on Earth and have a wealth of bioecological knowledge. Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) refers to the intimate knowledge of and relationship with the natural world developed over tens of thousands of years and passed down through generations. There are many complementary attributes between IEK and western scientific knowledge that can be woven together to co-develop research and co-create new knowledge.
