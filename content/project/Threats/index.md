Biodiversity is declining globally and therefore we must understand and manage threats effectively. We particularly focus on invasive predators and fire. In Australia, the invasive predators severely impacting our native species are the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats. While fire has shaped ecosystems and species in Australia, inappropriate fire regimes now threaten many areas. Understanding the impact of management actions of invasive predators and changed fire regions, and the subsequent outcomes for conservation,  is important when making effective decisions.
