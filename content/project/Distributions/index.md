title: "Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) and Population dynamics"
summary: "We develop, test and apply methods for predicting species distributions and abundance. Our research in population modelling is broad with topics ranging from theoretical, mathematical and management applications, particularly for threatened species, invasive species, fire, or scenario planning such as climate change."

Understanding where species occur and how populations will likely respond to future environmental change is essential to conservation. We develop, test and apply methods for predicting species distributions and abundance. Much of our research focuses on correlative species distribution models (SDMs, also known as ecological niche or habitat models) investigating new methods, assumptions and related to biogeography. We also research models that incorporate more mechanisms, including dynamic occupancy models, spatially-explicit population models, eco-physiological or mechanistic niche models and individual-based models.We apply these methods to a broad range of taxa and problems including threatened species, invasive species, fire management and climate change.
