Choosing between management options and balancing multiple or competing stakeholder goals is challenging. We investigate how the decision making can be best informed by science. Structured Decision Making provides a framework for working through the decision-making process in a logical manner, often dealing with conflicting objectives and scientific uncertainty. Prioritisation and optimisation are quantitative techniques based on data aiming to produce the best outcome within some constraints. With scarce funding and often conflicts between conservation and economic developments, methods that support decision making are becoming more prominent and essential to achieving conservation outcomes.
