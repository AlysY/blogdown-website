title: "Species Distribution Modelling"
summary: "Understanding where species may be is essential to spatial conservation planning. Species Distribution Models (SDMs), also known as niche or habitat models, attempts to predict a species distribution by relating where they are known to occur and possibly known not to occur with environmental characteristics."

Understanding where species may be is essential to spatial conservation planning. Species Distribution Models (SDMs), also known as niche or habitat models, attempts to predict a species distribution by relating where they are known to occur and possibly known not to occur with environmental characteristics.
