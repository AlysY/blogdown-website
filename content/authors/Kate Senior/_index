Kate is a postdoctoral researcher with the Infectious Disease Ecology and Modelling team at the Telethon Kids Institute, and an Honorary Research Fellow in the Infectious Disease Dynamics Unit, Melbourne School of Global and Population Health at the University of Melbourne.
While she currently models respiratory viruses like COVID-19, her former research focus was on fire ecology of south-east Australian plants, mammals and reptiles. She completed her PhD with QAECO on this topic from 2017-2020, followed by a research fellowship. She is a keen field ecologist and likes to blend field and quantitative methods to answer applied research questions.
