We are the Quantitative and Applied Ecology Research Group (QAEco), based in the [School of Agriculture, Food, and Ecosystem Sciences](https://safes.unimelb.edu.au) at the University of Melbourne.  QAEco is a diverse group of individuals who pursue a range of research topics in ecology.  In our work we tackle issues from the pressing - such as climate change and conservation - to the fundamental - such as population- and individual-level processes.  

Inclusiveness is at the heart of our philosophy; we believe that diverse teams are better equipped to address environmental and scientific problems. We value the richness brought to our community and our research by our diversity of ages, genders, sexualities, ethnicities, nationalities and cultural backgrounds.  We represent various socio-economic circumstances, as well as physical ability and mental health, and have diverse parenting, care-taking and other responsibilities outside of work.  We value our range of skills and academic styles, and seek to make our group a cohesive and inclusive space for everyone to learn, work and flourish in.
