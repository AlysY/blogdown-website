QAEco is a diverse group of individuals from various countries and cultures working in School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences at the University of Melbourne.  We are of diverse age, gender and sexual orientation, as well as racial, cultural and religious backgrounds.  We represent various socio-economic circumstances, as well as physical ability and mental health, and have diverse parenting, care-taking and other responsibilities outside of work.  

We greatly value the diversity of research topics pursued within the group, and the range of academic styles and skills each member brings to the team.  We recognise and appreciate the fact that diverse teams are better equipped to solve environmental and scientific problems.  

The values and opinions of all our colleagues are equally respected. We work together in a research-intensive environment, which can often be demanding. This requires that we learn and adopt best practices in being mindful of the challenges we face to make our group a cohesive and inclusive space for everyone to learn, work and flourish in.
